## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap - Grid

### What I learned

For CSS, I learnt that you can change CSS styles according to the width of the browser window. I used this to change the style of the border. Look at code snippet below:

```css
@media (max-width: 575px) {
  .sedans-col {
    border-radius: 5px 5px 0 0;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

In the future, I could focus on adding more elements/items for the background. At the moment, the background is white and plain, and I could have added extra elements to make it more interesting. This will help me improve my creativity and in the future, I could tackle projects with a more creative/innovative approach.


### Useful resources

- [@media query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21075983/how-to-use-particular-css-styles-based-on-screen-size-device/45695130) - This helped me for changing CSS styles based on screen size on device. I really liked this CSS query and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) - This is an amazing library which helped me implement a responsive design. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to make their website responsive.
